Dear neighbor,
My name is Song, and my family just moved in your next door.
We are very new to this town and country, and may be unfamiliar to the customs here.
In case we are found out of normal behavior or common sense, please feel free to tell
us what had been corrected to become a friendly neighbor of yours.
We always welcome to hear from you on whatever news you would share. It may take time for us
to get accustomed to all the new environment but we believe we will soon.

Best regards,
Song family

P.S. You have wonderful skill in gardening. It will be great if we can have talk about what to plant in my yard!
P.P.S. We love to cook our traditional treats! May we invite you on coming weekend? Please ping us if you are fine!!!
